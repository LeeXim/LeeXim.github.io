  - title: Expression quantitative trait loci for CCR4-NOT complex that regulate global gene expression

    description: A genome wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify expression quantitative trait loci 
    (eQTLs) for the CCR4-NOT complex that regulated gene expression at all steps. Data derived from RNA expression in 
    lymphoblastoid cells of 373 unrelated Europeans. We analyzed the genetic associations of SNPs with expression of 
    the genes encoding 10 proteins: CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CCR4a, CAF1, CAF40, CNOT10, CNOT11, and TAB182 among 
    CCR4-NOT complex. In the current study, we revealed 2 eQTLs associated with CNOT4 (P < ). One (rs114824303) of them 
    was located the intronic site of the gene encoding WD Repeat Domain 18 (WDR18). And then rs114824303 have strong 
    linkage with cis-eQTLs for gene encoding WDR18. WDR18 is well known subunit of Five Friends of Methylated Chromatin 
    Target(5FMC) that regulate gene expression dependent with ZNF148. CNOT4 target Promoter GH07J135507 (GeneHancer ID) 
    have ZNF 148 that is one of transcription factor binding sites. The current study suggested 2 novel eQTLs for CNOT4 
    and association with WDR18 of 5FMC. Further studies are required to understand their underlying mechanisms to unknown 
    pathway that includes CCR4-NOT complex and 5FMC complex.
