  description: A genome wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for the CCR4-NOT complex that regulated gene expression at all steps. Data derived 
from RNA expression in lymphoblastoid cells of 373 unrelated Europeans. We analyzed the genetic associations of SNPs 
with expression of the genes encoding 10 proteins: CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CCR4a, CAF1, CAF40, CNOT10, CNOT11, 
and TAB182 among CCR4-NOT complex. In the current study, we revealed 2 eQTLs associated with CNOT4 (P < ). One 
(rs114824303) of them was located the intronic site of the gene encoding WD Repeat Domain 18 (WDR18). And then 
rs114824303 have strong linkage with cis-eQTLs for gene encoding WDR18. WDR18 is well known subunit of Five Friends 
of Methylated Chromatin Target (5FMC) that regulate gene expression dependent with ZNF148. CNOT4 target Promoter 
GH07J135507 (GeneHancer ID) have ZNF 148 that is one of transcription factor binding sites. The current study 
suggested 2 novel eQTLs for CNOT4 and association with WDR18 of 5FMC. Further studies are required to understand 
their underlying mechanisms to unknown pathway that includes CCR4-NOT complex and 5FMC complex.
