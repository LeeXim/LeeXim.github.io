  Welcome, everybody!

  I am a graduate researcher at <a href="https://brainmil.wordpress.com/">Brain and Machine Intelligence Lab (BMIL)</a>, 
  Soongsil University in Seoul, South Korea. My present research topic is a Reinforcement Learning 
  algorithm inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience concept.
  
  I am currently interested in all field of RL (e.g., Offline RL, Imitation Learning, Inverse RL, and so on), 
  Federated learning, Cognitive science (or psychology), and Neuroscience.
  
  Previously, I majored in **Biotechnology** and **Bioinformatics** in School of 
  Systems Biomedical Science at Soongsil Univ in Seoul, South Korea. Additionally, I had double major in **Big Data Computing** System. 
  
  I had interned at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sskimb/">Post-Genome Informatics Lab</a> (Prof. Sangsoo Kim) 
  at School of Systems Biomedical Science, Soongsil University.
