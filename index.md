  Welcome, everybody!

  I am a graduate researcher at Brain and Machine Intelligence Lab (BMIL), Soongsil University in Seoul, South Korea.
  My present study is related to Reinforcement Learning algorithm inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience concept.
  
  I am currently interested in all field of RL (e.g., Offline RL, Imitation Learning, Inverse RL, and so on), 
  Federated learning, Cognitive science (or psychology), and Neuroscience.
  
  Previously, I had majored in Biotechnology and Bioinformatics in School of 
  Systems Biomedical Science at Soongsil Univ in Seoul, South Korea. Additionally, I had interned at 
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sskimb/">Post-Genome Informatics Lab</a> (Prof. Sangsoo Kim) at
