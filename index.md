  Welcome, everybody!

  I am a graduate researcher at <a href="https://brainmil.wordpress.com/">**Brain and Machine Intelligence Lab (BMIL)**</a> 
  (Prof.Minhae Kwon), **Soongsil Graduate School** in Seoul, South Korea. 
  My present research topic is a Reinforcement Learning algorithm inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience concept.
  
  I am currently interested in all field of RL (e.g., Offline RL, Imitation Learning, Inverse RL, and so on), 
  Federated learning, Cognitive science (or psychology), and Neuroscience.
  
  Previously, I majored in **Biotechnology** and **Bioinformatics** in **School of Systems Biomedical Science** 
  at Soongsil Univ in Seoul, South Korea. Additionally, I had double major in **Big Data Computing** System. 
  
  I had interned at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sskimb/">**Post-Genome Informatics Lab**</a> (Prof. Sangsoo Kim) 
  at School of Systems Biomedical Science, Soongsil University.
  
  Be able to confirm my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ug_2G5_srmvw6Mw-ZsO90djHS_xLr6iY/view">CV</a> if you want.
